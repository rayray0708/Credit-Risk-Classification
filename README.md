# Credit-Risk-Classification
In this project, I use various techniques to train and evaluate a model based on loan risk. Specifically, a dataset of historical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending services company will be used to build a model that can identify the creditworthiness of borrowers.

## Usage
To see the code for the credit risk classification model, please navigate to "credit_risk_classification.ipynb". The original dataset that I used to train the model is located in the "Resources" folder, under the "lending_data.csv" name. I've also written an analysis report, delineating the precision, recall and accuracy scores that the model achieved and whether this model should be used for the purpose of classifying high-risk loans. Please navigate to "report-template.md" to see my analysis.
